# Meeno - Your AI Meeting Note Taker
Insight Data Engineering PM consulting project

# Idea
Meeno is an AI assistant for meeting note-taking. Meeno is able to infer who-says-what from raw meeting audio, translates speech to text and then highlights important information like action items and dates.

# Purpose and Use case
It will be useful to automatically get all the details from a meeting without having to manually jot down the details and who said what.
As an extension we can then integrate the notes with other time-tracking apps like calendar etc.

# Technologies
Spark, S3, Postgres.
