# Speech-Processing
Insight Data Engineering PM consulting project

# Idea
Preprocess and organize a large amount of audio data to provide methods for people to translate this audio as well as detect certain sounds  within the audio.

# Purpose and Use case
Analyse the audio data to translate it if necessary, generate text from it and summarize the text. Suppose we are really interested in a TED talk but we don't have time to hear the complete talk, reading through a summary of it to understand what it is about will be beneficial.

# Technologies
Spark, S3, a database
